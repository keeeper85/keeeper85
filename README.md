## About me

### I am a person of many interests who likes learning new things. I used to be:
* a traveler (been to nearly 50 countries, Europe/Asia)
* a blogger (it's been over 15 years since I started my first website and I still publish)
* a teacher (was teaching English in China and Poland)
* a builder (I have renovated my house almost all by myself)
* and now a programmer (backend Java)

This all describes me as a person who's persistent and ready for challenges, careful and practical. I enjoy all forms of creation - from wood and concrete to words and code.
